Welcome to pmat v1.2. This photometry modular analysis tool(p-MAT) is currently in its first deployment and any contributions from outside labs
are greatly appreciated.  We encourage you to help correct errors, make improvements, and provide whatever support that you can.

Currently, the system is designed to work with the TDT acquisition system, although data from other systems can be imported in 'csv' files. 
Please reach out to david.barker@rutgers.edu if you are interested in trying to help develop this for your analysis pipeline.

MATLAB COMPATIBILITY:
This code was tested and developed in MATLAB 2019b. We have yet to test compatibility with prior versions of MATLAB.

REQUIRED TDT FILES:
https://www.tdt.com/support/matlab-sdk/

or for the latest release:
https://github.com/tdtneuro/TDTbin2mat

REQUIRED MATLAB PACKAGES:
-Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
-Curve Fitting Toolbox
 These are included automatically in the stand-alone deployment.

DOCUMENTATION:
We are currently working on the documentation files for pMAT and will release, as well as the software on both 
GitHub (GitHub.com/djamesbarker) as well as the Barker Lab website (www.thebarkerlab.com).  Please continue to check back for updates.
